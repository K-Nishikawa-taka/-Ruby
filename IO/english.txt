  Mind can be observed and known. 
  But you can know directly only your own mind, and not another's. 
  You may look into my face and guess the meaning of the smile or frown, and so read something of the mind's activity. 
  But that is not always right. 
  You may learn to recognize my features, know my voice, respond to the clasp of my hand; but the mind, the consciousness, which feels my joys and sorrows, You can never know completely.
